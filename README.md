# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to help the lead data scientist, Jill at the Fast Lending company to predict credit risk. I had to build and evaluate several machine learning models or algorithms to see which model would be best at predicting credit risk. I used techniques like resampling and boosting for these models and my data. Then I had to evaluate each model’s performance to see how well each one predicts data, since machine learning is good at helping businesses like banks and financial institutions predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud. 

## Results:

**Naive Random Oversampling**
